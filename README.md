# cs207project
For this project we've implemented 3 modules.

To use the *TimeSeries* module, from the root directory, `$ cd timeseries` and `$ python setup.py install` to install the package to your python site-packages. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/rubix-cube/cs207project/tree/master/timeseries).

For the *cs207rbtree* module, there's a PyPI version that you can directly pip install, but we recommand to install it by `$ cd cs207rbtree` and `$ python setup.py install`, since the version on PyPI may be outdated. See [here](https://github.com/rubix-cube/cs207project/tree/master/cs207rbtree) for more details.

The *similarity search* module and its usage can be found [here](https://github.com/rubix-cube/cs207project/tree/master/simsearch).
